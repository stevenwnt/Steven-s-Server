# Steven's WebPage
This is the source code for my servers webpage used for my game servers srb2 and tf2
now usely there would be a tf/maps folder but i don't own the code to the maps so im not adding here

the main goal / issue
all I'm looking for if you want to help is a leader broad system for each character and level in srb2 like as different pages for ex. you could only sonic and then it would ask you for what level then you chose the level and it will show the leaderboards if you want to do more then that then me my guest
